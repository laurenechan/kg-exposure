KG - Exposure
================================================
This directory includes code for the development of a knowledge graph (KG) developed using the KG hub template, using data from the Personalized Environments and Genes Study from NIEHS (https://joinastudy.niehs.nih.gov/studies/pegs) for a hypothesis generation investigation of how nutrition and environmental exposures impact female reproductive disorders. Data from PEGS is available by request to NIEHS. Additionally, this repository includes scripts used to complete logistic regressions and random forest based analyses for comparison to the KG findings.
